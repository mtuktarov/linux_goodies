# Routes are defined using the route() decorator to tell Flask what URL should trigger our function. In our case, we have a unique route / which triggers the index() function, and this route accepts GET and POST requests:


@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    # This index() function will have two blocks depending on the request type: GET or POST. If the request is of type GET, we simply show an html form which contains a text input named expression and a submit button
    if request.method == 'GET':
        # show html form
        return '''
            <h2>hostname: %s</h2>

                <input type="submit" value="Calculate" />
            </form>
        ''' % os.getenv('HOSTNAME')
#  If the function receive a POST which means that the form has been submitted, we retrieve the value filled inside the expression input using request.form object. After that, we evaluate the expression submitted using built-in eval() function and we print it in the browser:
    elif request.method == 'POST':
        # calculate result
        expression = request.form.get('expression')
        result = eval(expression)
        return '''
            <h2>hostname: %s</h2>

            </form>
        ''' % (os.getenv('HOSTNAME'), result)
